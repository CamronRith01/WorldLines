                <h2>Internal Visionary</h2>
                <p>Sometimes I'll sit on the roof of my house, gazing beneath the subtle moonlight. Not often, but when I feel the need to, I will. Especially at night alone. Detached from noisiness. Breathing the fresh air of nature. I would lay on my back, hands fitted underneath my scruffy black hair like a pillow, close my eyes, and ponder away, as if sinking into a deep slumber. Fragments of memories would come and go: my sister's spirit beyond the heavens; the four younger brothers looking up at me; a mother and father I wish to support. While these frames clicked through my conscience like tapes from a movie scene, it felt as though something was missing. Like I was on a blank canvas—empty. And for a moment, I thought to myself, "Is this really everything I wanted?"</p>

                <p>Prior to college, I had neither intention to pursue anything grandeur nor amazing. In fact, I preferred nothing more than my own solitude. “Sounds about something an introvert would say,” my friend chuckled. <em>Clearly</em>. However, it took one night to make up my mind; one night only, to discuss with my mother—single, who works seven days a week just for us to get by. It was right around midnight when she was stressed out, sobering up to alcohol, thinking about her relationships, money, and a plethora of problems. Something compelled me to reassure my mother. I told her something along the lines of, “I'm not going to college for myself, mom. I want to do this for you. I promise it will get better.” Her frowned face averted to a soft smile. Tears flowed down her red cheeks. And then she cried. And cried. And she cried some more. So, I cried with her. It was in this moment that all I could think about were my mother and siblings. Everything seemed so simple.</p>

                <p>The thought itself was selfless, innocent, and perhaps ignorant. Not because it was morally good, noble, or true to who I was, but rather because it was naive to the sharp malevolence and adversity of reality. I wanted nothing more than to be good, and yet, this heart and body of mine could not maintain the ideal conscience necessary to see it through. But, "the only way out is through," isn't it? It was from that premise that I <em>changed</em>. And <em>changed</em>. And <em>changed</em>. No matter how hard it got, I moved forward and <em>changed</em>. Eventually, a year had passed by, and I no longer looked at the world through the same lens. Inadvertently, the depth of my consciousness led me to believe that everything in my life is internal: the people, the problems, my family, even my <em>will to live.</em> It also led me to believe that the <span id="internal_visionary">internal visionary</span> is a reflection of our eternity.</p>
